## Development

The application uses Bun and Vite for development. To do so, with Bun installed, run `bun install`. You can use `bun run dev` to develop it.

After you are done, you should run `bun run build` to make sure that it builds on the server and ensure that it runs successfully when building on the server. You should also use `bun run lint:fix` to make sure the styling is correct.
